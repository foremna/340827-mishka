# üêªüéÅ Handmade Toy Store "Teddy Bear" 

Welcome to my **"Teddy Bear"** project repository! I'm excited to introduce this cozy online store of handmade toys, filled with warmth and love for crafting. My goal is to bring joy and inspiration to both little and big kids through unique toys made with heart.

## General Technical Requirements

### Adaptability
I have paid special attention to the adaptability of my project to be accessible on any device: from mobile phones to desktops. Thanks to the *"fluid"* design methodology, the content will be comfortably displayed on various screens.

### Graphics
All images in my project are optimized for retina screens, and I also use vector images to ensure clarity and quality on all devices.

### Methodology and Preprocessor
I adhere to the **BEM** methodology and my own coding style for more convenient and understandable code writing. For styling, I chose the *Less* preprocessor, which helps me efficiently organize the structure of styles and use mixins for code reuse.

### Automation Tools
For task automation, I use the **Grunt** tool, which significantly simplifies the project build process and increases my development productivity.

### Cross-browser Compatibility
My project has been thoroughly tested on various browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11, to ensure consistent quality display on all platforms.

### Font
For textual content, I use the *Open Sans* font, which ensures readability and a pleasant appearance for my store.

### Project Protection
My *"Teddy Bear"* project has successfully passed over 100 protection criteria and received the *"Professional HTML and CSS"* certificate, level 2 from HTML Academy, confirming a high level of quality and professionalism.

## Running Instructions

1. Download my project to your computer.
2. Install **Grunt**. If you're using Windows, run the command `npm install -g grunt-cli`, for MacOS run `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`.
3. Open the terminal, navigate to the project folder, and run the build by entering the command `npm run build && grunt serve`.

Now you're ready to enjoy the beauty and functionality of my *"Teddy Bear"* online store
